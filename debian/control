Description: Dedalus is a framework for solving partial differential equation
 Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations
 using spectral methods. The code is open-source and developed by a team of
 researchers studying astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.
 .
 Dedalus is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface
 with symbolic equation entry. Our numerical algorithm produces sparse systems
 for a wide variety of equations and spectrally-discretized domains. These
 systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and are automatically
 parallelized using MPI.
 .
 This package contains Dedalus for Python 3.
